## ![Overview](https://img.shields.io/badge/Overview-Discovery-orange?style=for-the-badge)

**![Ignite APP](https://img.shields.io/badge/Ignite_APP-Love_in_Action-FF69B4?style=for-the-badge)** is a dating app designed for users who value personality over superficial swiping. Instead of seeing a full profile immediately, users discover potential matches through a step-by-step reveal of key personality traits, ensuring compatibility is built on genuine interest.

## ![AIM](https://img.shields.io/badge/AIM-meaningfulCONNECTIONS-blue?style=for-the-badge)

- To revolutionise online dating by prioritising meaningful connections over superficial swiping.
- By using progressive personality/like matching system the app encourages users to engage with potential partners based on compatibility rather than appearance alone.

![How it Works](https://img.shields.io/badge/How_it_Works-Step_by_Step-blue?style=for-the-badge)

### üìù Step 1: Personalized Questionnaire

First up, users fill out a **quick questionnaire** to highlight their personality traits and preferences. No endless forms‚Äîjust enough to get a solid idea of what makes them tick.

### üí° Step 2: Finding a Match

- Matches are shown **one at a time**‚Äîno overwhelming lists or endless swiping.
- Instead of seeing a full profile straight away, users get a **single personality trait** (e.g., **Adventurous, Introverted**), represented by a simple image.
- If they **like** what they see, they move on to the **next trait** of that match.
- If they **don‚Äôt**, they move on to someone else‚Äîno harm, no foul.
- To reveal a full match, users need to **approve three traits in a row**.
- If they like all three, boom‚Äîthe match is **revealed**, and they finally see the person behind the traits.
- If at any point they‚Äôre not feeling it, they skip to a new match and start fresh.

### üí¨ Step 3: Connection

- Once a match is revealed, users can **choose to start a conversation**‚Äîno pressure, just an option.
- If they‚Äôre not interested, they simply move on and start the process again.

The whole idea is to **put personality first** and make connections that actually mean something. No snap judgments‚Äîjust a bit of curiosity and a fun way to discover people who genuinely click.

## ‚è≥ Time Commitment, Skills Gap & Team Effort

Hackathons typically suggest a commitment of **3‚Äì5 hours per day**, but for our team, this proved to be a challenge. Many members were only able to contribute **a few hours throughout the entire event**, in some cases **as little as 5 hours in total**.

This created a **significant gap** that had to be picked up by a core group of **four dedicated team members**, each putting in **12+ hours per day** to ensure our project came together. Alongside the time commitment, this also meant overcoming a **major skills gap**, requiring us to **learn on the fly, support each other, and step outside our comfort zones** to keep things moving.

Despite these challenges, we **pulled together as a team**, adapted where necessary, and made the best of the time and resources we had. It was a true demonstration of **resilience, problem-solving, and teamwork**, and we‚Äôre incredibly proud of what we achieved! üöÄüî•

![Pivot & Final Implementation](https://img.shields.io/badge/Pivot_&_Final_Implementation-Refined_Version-blueviolet?style=for-the-badge)

We originally planned to build this as a full-stack application using Django for the backend. However, due to time constraints and challenges with implementation, we decided to pivot and focus on a front-end prototype to effectively demonstrate our concept.

Rather than give up, we wanted to create something to showcase ‚Äîwe owed it to ourselves to bring our vision to life. We had a **fantastic idea that needed to be shared**, and this prototype allows us to present it in a way that highlights its potential.

Even this pivot was **a challenge in itself**, requiring all of us to **pull together, adapt, and contribute** to make it happen. Everyone played their part, stepping up to ensure we had something solid to present. It‚Äôs been a true team effort, and we‚Äôre proud of what we‚Äôve achieved! üí™üöÄ

![What we built](https://img.shields.io/badge/What_We_Built-Project_Overview-green?style=for-the-badge)

Instead of a fully functional application, we have created an interactive **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript prototype** that simulates the intended user experience. This includes:

- **Home Page** ‚Äì Overview of the platform
- **Profile Page** ‚Äì Displays user details and simulated matches
- **Find a Match Page** ‚Äì Simulates searching for potential matches
- **Login Page** ‚Äì UI for user authentication
- **Register Page** ‚Äì Form to collect user details for profile display

While there is no backend or database, **JavaScript** is used to create a dynamic experience that showcases the intended user journey. This allows us to effectively present our vision despite the technical constraints.

![Lessons Learned](https://img.shields.io/badge/Lessons_Learned-Key_Takeaways-yellow?style=for-the-badge)

- **Rapid prototyping** and adaptability are crucial in hackathon environments
- **Breaking down features** into smaller, manageable components helps maintain momentum
- **A front-end simulation** can still effectively communicate an idea without a full backend implementation

![Future Plans](https://img.shields.io/badge/Future_Plans-What‚Äôs_Next-00CED1?style=for-the-badge)

If we had more time, we would:

- Implement **Django** for user authentication and data storage
- Fully integrate **matchmaking logic** with a backend database
- Enhance **interactivity** with real-time updates

We‚Äôre proud of what we‚Äôve achieved in the time we had and excited to share our work! üéâ

## üî• !Final Word

Hackathons are an incredible way to connect with the coding community, learn from one another, and step away from the often overwhelming world of online learning. Throughout this journey, we faced our challenges head-on, adapted, and stayed committed to our vision.

What truly set us apart was our teamwork‚Äîembracing agile learning, problem-solving together, and communicating effectively. Every team member played a crucial role, bringing leadership, creativity, and motivation to the table. The energy and determination were inspiring, making this experience not just about coding, but about collaboration, resilience, and innovation.

A huge thank you to our team and the support from CI‚Äîyour guidance and encouragement made this possible.

We hope you enjoy "Ignite", our dating app that challenges the superficial nature of modern dating. In a digital era that often prioritises appearances, we believe it's time to return to the essence of true connection‚Äîunderstanding what a user truly wants and needs.

üíñ Enjoy the experience, spark meaningful connections, and let love ignite!
